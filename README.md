# Atom-Dreamweaver-Website

#Created with Dreamweaver and Atom. Started this project with Dreamweaver then switched to Atom. Mostly because Atom is free and Dreamweaver isn't.(Website)

#Discription of code- #This is a some what basic website. For anyone that is starting out this is a good templete to use. We have your normal links, images, and parahgraph tags in here. I used JQuery/Javascript, waypoints.js, bootstrap, typed.js, pooper js for this website. So you'll need to download the libs for those nice affects. You don't really need them for the website considering it's just a basic website but it's a work in progress.

#OpenSource- #Everything I've used is open source besides Dreamweaver which you can use for like a 7 day trial. Atom is a great alternative. You can download plugins that do just about the same thing as Dreamweaver. If you need help setting up Atom there are youtube videos showing how and blog post to help also. Atom also has their own GitHub so there's that too.

#Notice- #This is a work in progress project. Will update as I finish each page. You can use this as a templete if you want. Don't have to change anything if you don't want to. You can add or take away any code you want. If you do use it would like to know how you like it but I'll leave all that up to you. Just have fun with it.
